# Hundred Days of Python

An Udemy course made by Dr. Angela Yu.
We start from Day 16 for OOP studies, which is recommended for intermediate learners.

## Setup

1. Clone the git repository;

2. Setup a virtual environment (optional;)

3. '''pip install -r requirements.txt'''

4. Choose a folder with a main.py archive, select it and run it.

## What could go wrong

1. Before running the code you may have to select your Python interpreter manually.
And if you're using a virtual environment you may have to select it as your interpreter.
In this example we used VScode as our IDE, which let you select an interpreter by clicking a non-working import, for example.

## Day 16

The oop-coffe-machine-start folder contains the main.py archive that should be run.
The documentation for the coffee machine code that Dr. Angela Yu developed is not present
in this repo, but it should be understandable by what's on the main.py archive alone.
